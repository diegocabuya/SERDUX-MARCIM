# SERDUX-MARCIM
SERDUX-MARCIM: Maritime cyberattack simulation using compartmental models in epidemiology and agent-based modeling.

The repository has all the Matlab and NetLogo files relevant to the simulations used to develop the research project.

They are organized as follows:
- Matlab implementation of SERDUX-MARCIM, including the functions that numerically solve differential equations.
- Matlab executables that generate the GUIs allow a more pleasant visualization of the corresponding models and the desired parameters to be entered.
- NetLogo implementation of SERDUX-MARCIM, which has the simulation environment to be used by the experimenters.
