# SERDUX-MARCIM
SERDUX-MARCIM: Maritime cyberattack simulation using compartmental models in epidemiology and agent-based modeling.

The repository has all the Matlab and Netlogo files relevant to the simulations carried out in the development of the reserach project.

They are organized as follows:
- Matlab implementation of SERDUX-MARCIM, which includes the functions that solve differential equations numerically.
- Matlab executables which generates the GUIs that allow a more pleasant visualization of the corresponding models, and allow to enter the desired parameters.
- Netlogo implementation of SERDUX-MARCIM, which has the simulation enviroment to be used by the experimenters.
